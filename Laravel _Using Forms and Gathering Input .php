        Explain ORM ?
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Eloquent ORM (Object Relation Mapper) is easy to use for users who know how to use objects in PHP.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The ORM is an important feature of the Laravel framework, considered a powerful and expensive feature of Laravel. The ORM works with database objects and is used to make relationships with database tables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Each table of the database is mapped with a particular eloquent model.The model object contains various methods to retrieve and update data from the database table. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Eloquent ORM can be used with multiple databases by implementing ActiveMethod. This feature makes database-related tasks, such as defining relationships, simpler by defining the database tables. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        Explain - Eloquent Relationships ?
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When working with tables in a relational database, we can characterize relationships as connections between tables. This helps you organize and structure data effortlessly allowing for superior readability and handling of data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There are three types of database relationships in practice:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>one-to-one : One record in a table is associated with one, and only one, in another table. For example, a person and a social security number.</li>
                    <li>one-to-many : One record is associated with multiple records in another table. For instance, a writer and their blogs.</li>
                    <li>many-to-many : Multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table. Namely, students and the courses they are enrolled in.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
           
        </ul>
